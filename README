Sopranica generalizes your phone number so that you can send and receive calls
and SMS from any other phone, while only providing people with a single number,
or multiple numbers (ie. one per country) if you wish.

As of 2014-03-09, Sopranica is in the very early stages of development.  Initial
work has been done on the SMS Relay tool, which will accept XMPP messages on a
particular JID and forward them to other JIDs given a set of forwarding rules.
This is intended to be used with an SMS provider that offers an XMPP account for
sending and receiving SMS.  Currently the SMS Relay tool receives SMS and logs
them to standard out, and sends a test SMS every time the user hits Enter (until
the user types another key and hits Enter, at which point it exits).

To configure SMS Relay, put the following lines in settings-sms_relay.rb:

	LOGIN_USER = <jid_of_number_you_own>
	LOGIN_PWD = <password_for_above_user>
	DESTINATION_JID = <jid_to_send_sms_to>

In order to run SMS Relay, you need the following dependencies:
 * Ruby 1.9+ (older versions may work) - "apt-get install ruby" or similar
 * Blather - "gem install blather" or similar
