Sopranica generalizes your phone number so that you can send and receive calls
and SMS from any other phone, while only providing people with a single number,
or multiple numbers (ie. one per country) if you wish.

As of 2014-04-06, Sopranica is in somewhat early stages of development.  Initial
work has been done on the SMS Relay tool, which will accept XMPP messages on a
particular JID and forward them to other JIDs given a set of forwarding rules.
This is intended to be used with an SMS provider that offers an XMPP account for
sending and receiving SMS.  Currently the SMS Relay tool receives SMS and logs
them to standard out, and sends a test SMS every time the user hits Enter (until
the user types another key and hits Enter, at which point it exits).

SMS Relay also passes received messages on to SMS Mapper, which does a number
translation and then passes them on to SMS Publisher.  The publisher makes an
HTTP POST request to the API endpoint, which causes an SMS to be sent (using the
numbers defined in the mapper).  Messages coming back are not yet implemented.

SMS Relay has been tested with Vitelity's SMS-to-XMPP service.  SMS Publisher
has been tested with Plivo's SMS sending REST API.  Other services will be added
in the future and the code generalized to not assume any particular service.

To configure SMS Relay, put the following lines in settings-sms_relay.rb:

	LOGIN_USER = <jid_of_number_you_own>
	LOGIN_PWD = <password_for_above_user>
	DESTINATION_JID = <jid_to_send_sms_to>

To configure SMS Mapper, put the following lines in settings-sms_mapper.rb:

	OTHER_TO_USER = {
		['12125551234', '19175551234'] => ['16475551234', '14165551234']
	}
	USER_TO_OTHER = OTHER_TO_USER.invert

The 212 number is the recipient, the 917 number is your Plivo number, the 647
number is your Vitelity number, and the 416 number is your cell phone number
(you send messages from your cell to the Vitelity number and then SMS Publisher
will send them from your Plivo number to the recipient).

To configure SMS Publisher put the following lines in settings-sms_publisher.rb:

	AUTH_ID = <Plivo_AUTH_ID>
	AUTH_TOKEN = <Plivo_AUTH_TOKEN>

Once all three are configured, you can start them up in any order.  After they
have all started, SMS sent to your Vitelity number should be forwarded to the
recipient via your Plivo number, as configured in the SMS Mapper settings file.

In order to run SMS Relay/Mapper/Publisher, you need the following dependencies:
 * Ruby 1.9+ (older versions may work) - "apt-get install ruby" or similar
 * Blather - "gem install blather" or similar
 * FFI bindings for ZeroMQ - "gem install ffi-rzmq" or similar
